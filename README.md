User languages and interests

Notice that in the code snippet below, we have an array of users. Each user is an object. Each user has the key languages, which is associated with an array of strings. Each user also has the key interests, which is associated with an object. There are varying keys within this interests object, and each of those keys is associated with an array of strings.

Write a function called userLanguages that accepts an array of users, such as the one shown above. Return a string that lists all the users by first name and last name and the languages that each user knows. Make the string as nicely formatted as possible so that it is easy to read.
